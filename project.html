                <h3>Final Project Idea</h3>
                <p1>
                    Currently, my idea for the final project is some sort of interactive game that the user can play like Scrabble,
                    Hangman, or perhaps more ambitously: Chess. In any case, the user should be able to play against a 
                    computer oponent or even support some type of local multiplayer. In the past I have worked on a Chess game that was 
                    written in Python and had some success, however it could prove a nice challenge trying to implement it in a brand 
                    new language for me (Javascript).
